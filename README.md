# Game Ecommerce Store

Welcome to our Game Ecommerce Store, a one-stop solution for all your gaming needs. This application is designed to provide a seamless experience for purchasing and storing games in a personal library. It also includes a cart function for a smooth and efficient shopping experience.

## Features

- **Game Library**: A personal space where all your purchased games are stored for easy access and management.
- **Cart Functionality**: Add your favorite games to the cart and manage them efficiently before making a purchase.
- **Tailwind CSS**: The application is designed using Tailwind CSS, a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives us the ability to style our application in a unique and efficient manner.
- **SwiperJS**: We use Swiper, a modern touch slider, extensively for a mobile-friendly user interface.
- **CSS**: Alongside Tailwind CSS, we use vanilla CSS to style our application to ensure it is visually appealing.
